An attempt at understanding angles that turned into a pizza

This started as me learning how to get the arctangent of a known object around a known center point.
I just wanted to learn the math at first, but decided we'd gotten this far, so why not turn it into a pizza?

I used a game loop system for no other reason than for user input.
-Pizza toppings can be dragged around, and will spin with the pizza when on top of it
-Pizza toppings rotate around their center based on their angle to the pizza, starting at various initial angles for varied rotation
-Pizza toppings can be scaled to any size, center is adjusted appropriately
-Left and Right can rotate toppings off the pizza (as well as those on, causing them to go faster or stop depending on direction)
